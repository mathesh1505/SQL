# SQL
# 1 Relational Database Sysytem:
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database that stores data in the form of tables (rows and columns) and allows you to define relationships between those tables.
# 2 Database Management System:
It is software that helps you store, organize, and manage data efficiently in a structured way.
# 3 SQL Syntax:
SQL syntax is the set of rules that define how SQL statements are written and executed to interact with a database.Itâ€™s like grammar for the SQL language.
# 4 DDL:
DDL stands for Data Definition Language.It deals with defining and managing the structure of database objects.
# 4.1 CREATE	
Creates a new database or table

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language.It is used to manipulate the data stored inside database tables that means adding, changing, and deleting records.

# 5.1 INSERT

# 6.1 GRANT	
Gives permission to a user to perform actions
# 6.2 REVOKE

# 7.2 Group by:
The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns.It is usually used with aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN() to summarize data.

# 7.4 Order by:
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query.By default, it sorts in ascending order (ASC). You can also sort in descending order (DESC).It can sort by one or more columns.

# 9 Constraints: 
Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity.They ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.Constraints can be applied when creating a table or altering a table.

# 9.1 NOT NULL	
Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.
# 9.2 UNIQUE	
Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
# 9.3 PRIMARY KEY	
Uniquely identifies each row in a table. Cannot be NULL.
# 9.4 FOREIGN KEY	
Ensures the value in a column matches a value in another table, enforcing referential integrity.
# 9.5 CHECK
